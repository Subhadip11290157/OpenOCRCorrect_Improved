# OpenOCRCorrect_Improved
Added and tested new features like **bold, superscript and subscripts**.
This is part of an assignment where the following improvements were to be made:-
- a. adding bold/unbold feature for selected texts
- b. adding superscript feature for selected texts
- c. adding subscript feature for selected texts

These changes were made to this repository: https://github.com/rohitsaluja22/OpenOCRCorrect
Hence this is an improved version of the original OCR software.
- Installation, building and running guides, feature details, issues/challenges and references of 
a text editor software that incorporates similar functionalities have been provided in README section 
of this repository - https://github.com/Subhadip11290157/Textop (which constitutes part 1 of this assignment)
